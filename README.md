## Description

For this challenge at first I thought that there was not much to fix, however the more I looked over the CSS I notcied some flaws. There was a lot of repeating codes that made the overall code harder to work with. So what did was I took the CSS and condensed the file. 
While condensing the files I broke the web page a few times, but I was eventually able to return the web page to it's orginal form. I also updated the HTML file, I submitted this homework and fixed the mistakes that I had missed before. I now hope everything is fixed and that my grade will reflect that.
